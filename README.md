# Agent2077

Agent2077 is a self-hosted AI agent workspace for running local and OpenAI-compatible models with real tools. It gives you a browser UI where an agent can chat, inspect projects, write code, run commands, remember context, use skills, and deploy Docker-backed apps from one local machine.

## Highlights

- **Local-first agent loop**: run against LM Studio, OpenRouter, or any generic OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.
- **Smart tool selection**: sends only the tools relevant to the current task instead of dumping every tool schema into every request.
- **Tool discovery on demand**: `tool_list` and `tool_search` let the agent browse the full tool catalogue without bloating the system prompt.
- **Project workspace**: create or open coding projects, let the agent read/edit files, and keep project-specific context separate from normal chat.
- **Docker app deployment**: build and manage generated web apps, tools, and games from the built-in App Store.
- **Persistent memory and skills**: store reusable knowledge, search memory, and maintain task-specific skill instructions.
- **Multi-model orchestration**: register multiple endpoints and models, mark orchestrators, assign task types, and benchmark model behavior.
- **Reliability guards**: deterministic request routing, malformed tool-call repair, targeted failure nudges, and an adjustable failed-tool-call cap.
- **Self-dev mode**: optional tools for Agent2077 to inspect and improve its own codebase.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- SQLite, bundled through `better-sqlite3`
- Docker, optional but recommended for code execution and app deployment
- At least one LLM endpoint:
  - LM Studio local server
  - OpenRouter
  - any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint

Agent2077 can start without Docker, but code execution and app deployment are disabled until Docker is available.

## Quick start
Agent2077 is meant to be run on its own linux machine and server on the local network.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustLateNightAI/Agent2077.git agent2077
cd agent2077
npm install
npx tsx script/build.ts
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.cjs

add the "--listen flag" to have it start serving on the local network.
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

Default login:

```text
Username: Agent2077
Password: Agent2077
```

Change the default password in **Settings → Security** before exposing the app to a network.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

By default the server binds to localhost. Enable LAN serving from **Settings → Network** if you want access from other machines on your network.

## Configure a model endpoint

Go to **Settings → API Endpoints** and add one of:

- **LM Studio**: usually `http://localhost:1234`
- **OpenRouter**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- **OpenAI Compatible**: any provider or local gateway exposing `/v1/chat/completions`

After adding an endpoint, click sync to discover models. Enable one or more models, then choose which models support tool calling, vision, orchestration, or sub-agent work.

## How Agent2077 works

   ├── Agent loop
   │     ├── request router
   │     ├── compact system prompt
   │     ├── smart tool selector

   │     └── failure classifier

   ├── Tool registry
   ├── Project workspace
   ├── Memory and skills
   ├── Docker app manager
   └── SQLite database
```

The current prompt/tool pipeline is designed to keep local models responsive:

1. Classify the request with a deterministic router.
2. Build a compact system prompt with only relevant modules.
3. Select a small tool subset for the current route, plan, model, and project mode.
4. Repair malformed tool calls before execution when possible.
5. Inject targeted recovery guidance for repeated failures.

## Important settings

- **Smart tool selection**: enabled by default. Set `smart_tool_selection` to `"false"` to send the full tool registry.
- **Max consecutive failed tool calls**: configurable in Settings. Backend key: `agent.maxFailedToolCalls`.
- **Internet kill switch**: disables outbound web/search tools while keeping local tools available.
- **OpenRouter balance floor**: optional per-endpoint spend guard.
- **LAN serving**: disabled by default for safety.

## Project structure

```text
client/                 React frontend
server/                 Express API, agent loop, tools, storage
server/lib/             core agent modules
server/tools/           registered tools
shared/                 shared database schema and types
script/                 build and smoke-test scripts
data/                   local SQLite database, memory files
docs/screenshots/       README screenshots
```

## Useful scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # development server
npm run build     # production client + server bundle
npm start         # run built server
npm run db:studio # open Drizzle Studio
```

Additional smoke tests live in `script/`, including tool selector, tool discovery, router, repair, and failure-classifier checks.

## Security notes

Agent2077 can execute commands, edit files, connect to model endpoints, and deploy containers. Treat it like a local developer tool with real system access.

- Change the default password immediately.
- Keep LAN serving disabled unless you need it.
- Use a strong `JWT_SECRET` in production.
- Review model endpoint keys and Docker access before sharing a machine.
- Do not expose the server directly to the public internet without a proper reverse proxy and authentication hardening.

## Status

Agent2077 is under active development. Expect fast iteration around local-model reliability, tool routing, project workflows, and app deployment.
